# Javascript-Capstone

The JavaScript capstone project is about building our own web application based on an external API. The webapp have 2 user interfaces:

- A `Home Page` displying items that you can `like`
- A `Comment` button on home page display a `Popup window` with more detail about item.
- In `Popup` user can add `comments` and it will be prserved in `API`.
- We use an `API` that provides data about food and we make our webiste accoding to the data. [Meals DB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)
- In this project we practice to give review to each other.
- We follow `Gitflow` for this project and solve `git conflicts`

### Project Requirements

- You should build these interfaces 
  - The home page.
  - The comments popup.
- You should follow the layout of the wireframes provided. You should personalize the rest of the design including colors, typographies, spacings, etc.
- Home page
  - When the page loads, the webapp retrieves data from:
    - The selected API and shows the list of items on screen.
    - The Involvement API to show the item likes.
  - Remember that your page should make only 2 requests
    - One to the base API.
    - And one to the Involvement API.
  - When the user clicks on the Like button of an item, the interaction is recorded in the Involvement API and the screen is updated.
  - When the user clicks on the "Comments" button, the Comments popup appears.
  - Home page header and navigation similar to the given mockup.
  - Home page footer similar to the given mockup.
- Comments popup
  - When the popup loads, the webapp retrieves data from:
    - The selected API and shows details about the selected item.
    - The Involvement API to show the item comments.
  - When the user clicks on the "Comment" button, the data is recorded in the Involvement API and the screen is updated.

**Counters** We have counters in all the interfaces that show:
  - The number of items (home).
  - The number of comments (comments popup).
